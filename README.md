# Ideabox
This application enables users to capture their ideas on virtual cards. Users can input a title and a brief description for their ideas, which will then be displayed on the page.

## Technologies Used
Utilizing React and the create-react-app toolkit, the project is built with a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a seamless web experience.

## Learning Goals:
Currently, as a front-end development student at the Turing School of Software Engineering, I'm diving deep into Module 3's curriculum. A pivotal part of my learning journey is the project based on Turing's Module 3 lesson: IdeaBox lesson. This project is instrumental in solidifying my grasp on React, specifically its functional component-based architecture.

Through this endeavor, I aim to:

Delve deeper into the fundamental concepts of React, emphasizing its functional component paradigm.
Showcase my ability to harness React's functional components in building a real-world application.
Enhance my comprehension of React's modular and component-based design.
Adopt industry-standard methodologies for structuring and managing a React project.
Craft a responsive and intuitive user interface by leveraging React's declarative style and component-driven framework.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
